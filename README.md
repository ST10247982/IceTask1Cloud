Hi sir, i know my work is really bad, i was just struggling to grasp the concepts as i have been a bit slack with my work, so i only started the tutorial and the app today. I admit that this was my bad and 
i have no one else to blame. I was never this type of student and i just wanted to make this readme as the app will be as dissapointing for you as it was for me to submit this but i just needed to submit 
something. 
My apologies for the let down.
